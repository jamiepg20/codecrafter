# Projects

Here are a bunch of micro serices, each runs independantly, also integrates with the other services running in conjunction.

## Database setup

First of all you'll need a database.   Any of the spring boot apps will take responsibility to update or alter their own schema within this one datasource. (KIS for now)

**MySQL**
```markdown
create database repository;
show databases;
create user coder;
grant all on repository.* to 'coder'@'localhost' identified by 'coffee';
```


_ignore any thing below this line for now_

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/arnoe/codecrafter/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/arnoe/codecrafter/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
