# Projects

Here are a bunch of micro serices, each runs independantly, also integrates with the other services running in conjunction.

## Ticker

Gathers the latest prices of each of these vendors

#### Vendors
- luno.com _(using fixer.io to convert ZAR to USD)_
- bitstamp.net
- cex.io (incomplete)

### Database

First of all you'll need a database

```markdown
create database repository;
show databases;
create user coder;
grant all on repository.* to 'coder'@'localhost' identified by 'coffee';
```

### Checkout, build, start app

Pull the latest code from repository, execute bootRun, which will clean, build and run the ticker services

```markdown
git clone git@github.com:arnoe/codecrafter.git
cd codecrafter
cd ticker
../gradlew bootRun
```

### Analysis

#### REST
Latest tickers
http://localhost:8000/ticker?sort=timestamp,desc&size=5

Refer to [REST API pagination in Spring](http://www.baeldung.com/rest-api-pagination-in-spring) to view objects

#### MySQL

```markdown
SELECT
  source,
  concat(round(min(price)), ' USD') AS min,
  concat(round(max(price)), ' USD') AS max,
  max(price) - min(price) AS spread
FROM ticker 
GROUP BY source
```

## Equity

Having accounts with some of these following vendors, it would be nice to track your equity.  Ideally this app should be lauched with your own account details, which will track your own equity.

#### Vendors 
- luno.com _(using fixer.io to convert ZAR to USD)_
- bitstamp.net
- cex.io (incomplete)
